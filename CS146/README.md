This folder contains coursework for my fall 2018 course CS146 Modern Computational Statistics.

5.1.py is an example of Bayesian inference with Stan models.  
CS146Assignment4.ipynb is posterior predictive tests.  
CS146Week4-6Homework.ipynb is a Bayesian inference homework consisting of 3 problems: problem 1 involved modelling a call center dataset using an exponential likelihood with a gamma prior, problem 2 involved modelling data using a normal likelihood with a normal-inverse-gamma prior, and problem 3 involved modelling high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) log-normal data. All 3 problems used Stan.
