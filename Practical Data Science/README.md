Welcome to my Practical Data Science folder, a course I took during the spring of 2020.

## Files
### Preprocessing_Text_Data_in_Python.ipynb
This file contains a tutorial for preprocessing text data in Python. For a full explanation, please check out my Medium article here: https://towardsdatascience.com/preprocessing-text-data-in-python-an-introduction-via-kaggle-7d28ad9c9eb


### lime_explanation_cactus_model.ipynb
This file contains a model interpretation of a Convolutional Neural Network using LIME, which stands for Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations. This Convolutional Neural Network, which was constructed by my classmates, was designed to take on the Aerial Cactus Identification challenge from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification). This code uses LIME to better understand how the CNN identifies cactuses in images.
