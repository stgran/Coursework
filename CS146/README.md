This folder contains coursework for my fall 2018 course CS146 Modern Computational Statistics.

5.1.py is an example of Bayesian inference with Stan models. It was completed in September, 2018.  
CS146Assignment4.ipynb is posterior predictive tests. It was completed in November, 2018.  
CS146Week4-6Homework.ipynb is a Bayesian inference homework consisting of 3 problems: problem 1 involved modelling a call center dataset using an exponential likelihood with a gamma prior, problem 2 involved modelling data using a normal likelihood with a normal-inverse-gamma prior, and problem 3 involved modelling high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) log-normal data. All 3 problems used Stan. It was completed in October, 2018.
