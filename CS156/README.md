This folder contains courseword for my fall 2018 course CS156 Machine Learning for Science and Profit.

CS156Assignment4SVM.ipynb is an assignment focused on Support Vector Machines using Scikit-learn. It was completed in November, 2018.  
CS156AssignmentPCALDA.ipynb is an assignment about Principal Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis as methods for dimensionality reduction. It was completed in October, 2018.  
CS156LBA.ipynb is an assignment about using Principal Component Analysis to reduce time-lapse photos of the same site to 2 dimensions and then reconstruct each image from its low-dimension representation. Finally, we had to choose a different 2D point and reconstruct it using the same PCA model. It was completed in December, 2018.
